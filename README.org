* DIY Synth & GUI workshop with STM32F7 (ARM Cortex-M7)

** Overview

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lL-ZxyrHiE][Video documentation]]

** Status

Stable

** Examples / exercises

*** ex01 - Hello Blinky

Simple LED blink example and GPIO (push button) handling, polling vs.
EXTI interrupt

*** ex02 - Timers & interrupts

Introduction to timers, configuration and custom interrupt handlers.
Useful for basic multi-tasking.

*** ex03 - LCD, multitouch & GUI

Introduction to LCD driver, HAL BSP drawing functionality, state
machines, GUI components & multi-touch handling. Press blue user
button to switch between modules.

*** ex04 - Synth, DSP & GUI

Complete synth, GUI controls & timer integration. See video above.

**** Oscillator types

Oscillator types are set via the following 3-bit patterns:

| *Spiral* | *Sin* | *Square* | *Saw* | *Sawsin* | *Tri* | *String* |
|----------+-------+----------+-------+----------+-------+----------|
| [ ]      | [x]   | [ ]      | [x]   | [ ]      | [x]   | [ ]      |
| [ ]      | [ ]   | [x]      | [x]   | [ ]      | [ ]   | [x]      |
| [ ]      | [ ]   | [ ]      | [ ]   | [x]      | [x]   | [x]      |

**** Filter types

Filter types are set via the following 2-bit patterns:

| *LPF* | *HPF* | *BPF* | *PEQ* |
|-------+-------+-------+-------|
| [ ]   | [x]   | [ ]   | [x]   |
| [ ]   | [ ]   | [x]   | [x]   |

This demo only makes use of biquad filters, though other filter types
are possible (IIR, Formant, 4pole...)

** Building the exercises

This repo contains a complete Eclipse CDT project and can be built
with [[http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io][GNU ARM Eclipse]] plugin. Furthermore, the [[https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded][ARM GCC toolchain]] is
required outside Eclipse.

Within the project, you can find several build configurations, one per
example/exercise. Build profiles can be switched by clicking on the
little triangle next to the hammer (build) icon in the main toolbar.
Once a profile has been built, you'll find the resulting =.bin= file
in the profile's subfolder of this project. E.g. =ex04='s binary will
be located in ={$PROJECT_DIR}/ex04/ws-ldn-4.bin=.

The STM32F746-DISCO board is mbed enabled and therefore can be
programmed/flashed via simple drag & drop. Simply move a =.bin= file
on to the USB volume the board shows up as in OSX Finder or Windows
Explorer. Under Linux, please use the st-flash tool and invoke like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd ws-ldn-4
st-flash --reset write ex04/ws-ldn-4.bin 0x8000000
#+END_SRC
