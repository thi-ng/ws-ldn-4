* DIY Synth & GUI workshop with STM32F7 (ARM Cortex-M7)

** Video documentation

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41FKE3PYjnE][MIDI step sequencer]] (ex05)
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lL-ZxyrHiE][Synth GUI documentation]] (ex04)

** Status

Stable

** Examples / exercises

*** ex01 - Hello Blinky

Simple LED blink example and GPIO (push button) handling, polling vs.
EXTI interrupt

*** ex02 - Timers & interrupts

Introduction to timers, configuration and custom interrupt handlers.
Useful for basic multi-tasking.

*** ex03 - LCD, multitouch & GUI

Introduction to LCD driver, HAL BSP drawing functionality, state
machines, GUI components & multi-touch handling. Press blue user
button to switch between modules.

*** ex04 - Synth, DSP & GUI

Complete synth, GUI controls & timer integration. See video above.

**** Oscillator types

Oscillator types are set via the following 3-bit patterns:

| *Spiral* | *Sin* | *Square* | *Saw* | *Sawsin* | *Tri* | *String* |
|----------+-------+----------+-------+----------+-------+----------|
| [ ]      | [x]   | [ ]      | [x]   | [ ]      | [x]   | [ ]      |
| [ ]      | [ ]   | [x]      | [x]   | [ ]      | [ ]   | [x]      |
| [ ]      | [ ]   | [ ]      | [ ]   | [x]      | [x]   | [x]      |

**** Filter types

Filter types are set via the following 2-bit patterns:

| *LPF* | *HPF* | *BPF* | *PEQ* |
|-------+-------+-------+-------|
| [ ]   | [x]   | [ ]   | [x]   |
| [ ]   | [ ]   | [x]   | [x]   |

This demo only makes use of biquad filters, though other filter types
are possible (IIR, Formant, 4pole...)

*** ex05 - MIDI step sequencer

MIDI example ported from [[http://thi.ng/ws-ldn-3][previous workshop]] (then using STM32F401),
implementing a 2-track, 8-step MIDI sequencer using buttons of the
Korg Nanokontrol2. The MIDI configuration (in =ex05/main.h=) is still
set for the Nanokontrol and I've also uploaded a configuration file
(nanokontrol2.nktrl2_data) which you can use with the Korg Kontrol
Editor app (can be downloaded from here:
http://www.korg.com/uk/products/controllers/nanokontrol2/ - further
down on that page).

The Nanokontrol is configured as follows:

- the first row of buttons ("S") is used as 8 step sequencer for track 1
- the second row of buttons ("M") => track 2
- 2 leftmost sliders control filter cutoff freq for sequencer tracks 1 & 2
- 2 leftmost dials controls resonance for each filter
- 3rd dial => delay feedback
- 4th & 5th dial => attack time for track 1 & 2
- Marker left/right => change waveform for oscillator 1 (all tracks)
- Track left/right => transpose current sequence by -12, -5, 0, +7 or
+12 semi-tones
- Rewind, Stop & Play do as expected (when the app starts, it is in
Pause mode - you'll need to press Play and activate at least one "S"
or "M" button)

The notes played in each sequencer track are randomly chosen from a
musical scale defined in the source code. If you don't like a note,
simply de-activate and then press the "S" or "M" button again to get
another semi-random note. See the live video recording (link above)
for reference...

If you have a different MIDI controller, you'll have to edit the MIDI
control message IDs in the =ex05/main.h= file for this example. Note,
that your controller *MUST* be able to emit MIDI CC messages. With a
bit more work this can of course also be extended to proper MIDI Note
On/Off messages...

** Building the exercises

This repo contains a complete Eclipse CDT project and can be built
with [[http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io][GNU ARM Eclipse]] plugin. Furthermore, the [[https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded][ARM GCC toolchain]] is
required outside Eclipse.

Within the project, you can find several build configurations, one per
example/exercise. Build profiles can be switched by clicking on the
little triangle next to the hammer (build) icon in the main toolbar.
Once a profile has been built, you'll find the resulting =.bin= file
in the profile's subfolder of this project. E.g. =ex04='s binary will
be located in ={$PROJECT_DIR}/ex04/ws-ldn-4.bin=.

*Important:* The build profile called "base" is only a template and is
NOT buildable. However it is the default profile after importing the
project into Eclipse. So if it starts building the project
automatically and you get lots of errors, let it finish and then
select one of the example profiles ("ex01"...) as described above.

The STM32F746-DISCO board is mbed enabled and
therefore can be programmed/flashed via simple drag & drop. Simply
move a =.bin= file onto the USB volume the board shows up as in OSX
Finder or Windows Explorer. Under Linux, please use the [[https://github.com/texane/stlink][st-flash]] tool
and invoke like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd ws-ldn-4
st-flash --reset write ex04/ws-ldn-4.bin 0x8000000
#+END_SRC
